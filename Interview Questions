Helen Zulch - Animal Behaviour Expert
Goal: Understand animal welfare implications, behavioral reactions, and ethical treatment.
	1.	From your perspective, what behavioral signs would indicate stress in sheep when interacting with a robot dog?
	2.	Do you think sheep could habituate to a robotic herder over time? What factors would affect that?
	3.	Are there known animal behavior risks in automating tasks like herding?
	4.	What principles should guide ethical robot-animal interaction design?
	5.	What measurable indicators should be monitored to ensure welfare is protected?
	6.	How do you perceive the replacement of trained dogs with robots in terms of animal ethics?
	7.	What kinds of studies would you want to see before approving widespread use

Jack Grant - Agri Tech Researcher
Goal: Assess the technological feasibility, design risks, and ethical automation issues.
	1.	What are the current limitations of robotics in real-time animal interaction?
	2.	What autonomy level do you think is appropriate for robots working with animals?
	3.	How do you account for unpredictability in animal behavior when designing systems like this?
	4.	How could robotic systems be made transparent and ethically responsive in animal environments?
	5.	What design principles help ensure robots are non-threatening to animals?
	6.	Are current AI systems capable of learning from animal feedback in real-time?
	7.	What concerns do you have about deploying robotic shepherds at scale?

Matt Bagley - Sheep Dog Trainer
Goal: Understand operational realities, traditional knowledge, market receptivity.
	1.	What qualities make a good working dog in herding? How might a robot replicate or fail to replicate those?
	2.	Do you believe a robot dog could be an acceptable or desirable tool in your community?
	3.	What potential benefits or risks do you see in replacing dogs or human shepherds with machines?
	4.	How do you think animals would respond compared to trained dogs?
	5.	Would such a system save time or introduce new complications?
	6.	What factors would influence a farmerâ€™s willingness to adopt such technology?
	7.	Do you see cultural or emotional barriers to replacing real dogs?
